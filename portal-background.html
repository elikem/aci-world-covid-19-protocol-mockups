            <h1>ACI COVID-19 Protocol Portal Background</h1>

            <p>The Airports Council International (ACI) COVID-19 Protocol Portal was developed by ACI as a service
                to the industry and the traveling public in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The portal allows
                airports to self-report airport measures, airport services, and passenger requirements. Following submission,
                airport responses will be reviewed and published to ACI's website upon approval. Airport
                participation is entirely voluntary.</p>
            <p>The registering party should have the authority to submit information on behalf of the Airport.</p>
