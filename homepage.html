            <p>The Airport Council International (ACI) COVID-19 Protocol Portal was developed by ACI as service to the industry and the traveling public in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The portal allows airports to self-report airport measure, airport services, and passenger requirements. Following submission, airport responses will be reviewed and published to ACI's website upon approval. Airport participation is entirely voluntary.</p>
            <p>The registering party should have the authority to submit information on behalf of the Airport.</p>
