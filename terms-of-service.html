            <p>The Airports Council International (ACI) COVID-19 Protocol Portal was developed by ACI as a service
                to the industry and the traveling public in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The portal allows
                airports to self-report airport measures, airport services, and passenger requirements. Airport
                participation is entirely voluntary.</p>
            <p>ACI has developed and controls the Airport Programming Interface Portal ("the ACI COVID-19 Protocol")
                that enables airports to share their information using this online portal for third-party use. The ACI
                COVID-19 Protocol Portal is a data aggregator that enables third parties (such as airlines, travel
                apps, etc.) to access data for airport information in a standardized format using a single online
                portal.</p>
            <p>Airport grants to ACI worldwide, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, fee-bearing license to use
                and reproduce the information solely for the purpose of providing the same to the travelling public.
                ACI acknowledges that the information is the sole and exclusive property of airport, and does not
                confer any transfer of title to, or ownership of, the information to ACI or any other third-party,
                whether through the use of the information or other wise. Airport agrees that the information
                submitted is correct to the best of the Airport knowledge at the time of submission. Airport can
                review and update the information submitted at any time.</p>
            <p>By checking this box, on behalf of Airport, I agree to the terms of conditions and certify that I have
                the authority to submit information behalf of Airport.</p>
